# DataScienceEcosystem
Final Assignment: Jupyter Notebook Project in Skills Network   
Course: IBM Data Science Proessionals Certificate   
2nd Module: Tools for Data Science  

## Overview

As part of the assignment, I have included required screenshots to document each step. These images serve as proof of completion and follow the specified formatting guidelines (.jpg or .png).
Notebook Structure

1. Jupyter Notebook Creation
The project begins with the creation of a new Jupyter Notebook titled DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb.
1. Notebook Title
The first markdown cell contains an H1-style heading: Data Science Tools and Ecosystem.
1. Introduction
An introductory markdown cell explains the purpose of the notebook:
“In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.”
1. Data Science Languages
A numbered list outlines some of the most popular languages used in data science.
1. Data Science Libraries
Another ordered list highlights commonly used data science libraries.
1. Data Science Tools Table
A single-column table presents three open-source development environments used in data science.
1. Arithmetic Expression Examples
An H3-style markdown heading introduces arithmetic expression examples:
“Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.”
1. Multiplication and Addition
A code cell demonstrates the calculation of (3*4)+5, with a comment explaining the operation.
1. Minutes to Hours Conversion
A simple Python expression converts 200 minutes into hours (200/60).
1. Key Objectives
A markdown cell lists the key takeaways of the notebook under Objectives, presented as bullet points.
1. Author Information
A markdown cell labeled Author (H2-style) includes my name.
1. GitHub Repository
The completed notebook is uploaded to a public GitHub repository as per the assignment requirements.
1. Submission

### Conclusion
A screenshot of the first page of the notebook (1-notebook.png) is included for verification.
This project is part of my course’s final assignment, where I demonstrate my understanding of Jupyter Notebooks, markdown formatting, and GitHub sharing. The notebook, DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb, includes various exercises covering essential data science concepts and tools.
This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to work with Jupyter Notebooks, document findings using markdown, and share work effectively on GitHub. It reflects my understanding of fundamental data science tools and concepts learned throughout the course.
